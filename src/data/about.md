I'm Julia, a fourth-year **Computer Science** student studying at the [University of British Columbia (UBC)]({ubcLink}) interested in creating accessible tech for all people.

I previously interned at [Amazon Web Services]({awsLink}) as a **Software Development Engineer Intern** on the AWS Payments team where I got to build a new ticketing service for my team! I was also a **Software Developer** at the [UBC x AWS Cloud Innovation Centre]({cicLink}) where I developed cloud-based prototypes to solve real-world challenges.

Beyond software development, I enjoy teaching and developing educational material! I've developed open-source Python course material, was a Teaching Assistant for an undergraduate software course, and led game-based scripting classes.

When I'm not solving software puzzles, you can find me playing badminton, sketching/painting, or catching the sunset! 🏸 🎨 🌅
