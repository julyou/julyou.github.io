I'm Julia, a fourth-year **Computer Science** student studying at the [**University of British Columbia (UBC)**]({ubcLink}) interested in creating accessible tech for all people.

I previously interned at [**Amazon Web Services**]({awsLink}) on the AWS Payments team where I got to build a new ticketing service for my team. I also interned at the [**UBC x AWS Cloud Innovation Centre**]({cicLink}) where I developed cloud-based prototypes to solve real-world challenges.

Beyond software development, I enjoy **teaching and developing educational material**! I've developed open-source Python courses, was a Teaching Assistant for an undergraduate software course, and led game-based scripting classes.

When I'm not solving software puzzles, you can find me playing badminton, sketching/painting, or catching the sunset! 🏸 🎨 🌅
